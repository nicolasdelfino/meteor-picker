# PICKER:  

Picker is a personal project designed to help 2 friends decide on stuff by playing a round of (insert simple game). 

  - Built with Meteor
  - Magic
  - Default game is Tic-Tac-Toe

### Version
0.1.0

### Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nicolasdelfino/meteor-picker picker
$ cd picker
$ meteor
```
### Disclaimer

Picker assumes the players will finish the round in one go. The player that inits the game gets a cross tile, the second one a circle, and the rest become spectators. Will try to update to a smarter solution.

### Todos

 - A better solution to players taking turns
 - Make a second game, Rock-paper-scissors
 - Add more code comments
